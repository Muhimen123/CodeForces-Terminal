# CodeForces Terminal
## See codeforces problems in your terminal


CodeForces Terminal is a CLI app. With the help of this application, you can read most of the problems in codeforces.

## Usage
Until now, this program has only one operation and it is to show CF problems in the terminal. The program it self is pretty self explanatory and straight forward. You shouldn't have any problem using this.

In order to see a specific problem, you need to input the problem ID. 
And a problem id look likes this: ```541B```.

However, you will need to enter a problem ID in this format `541-b` to get valid output.

The letter is case incencitive, so don't worry about that.

Once you enter a valid problem ID, you will see the problem in your terminal.

### Feel free to contribute 
If you write python programs like me and believe that you can make some useful change in the code then do it! This is what open source is all about. You can also help by contributing a better documentation.
However, if you don't write python programs, then just use the program and report issues or bug if you face any.
